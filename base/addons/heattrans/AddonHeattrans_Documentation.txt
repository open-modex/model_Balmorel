Addon heattrans for the Balmorel model.
Originally developed by Hans Ravn.

In the standard version of Balmorel the heat consumption and generation are specified at area level,
and there is no possibility of transmitting heat from one area to another.
The addon heattrans implements such heat transmission.

It will be done in a way which is similar to the way electricity transmission between regions is modelled.
Indeed, the main formal difference essentially is that electricity transmission code is duplicated
where pairs of regions are replaced by pairs of areas, areas taking the place of regions,
and the names of identifiers related to heat transmission contain the letter combination XH.

Therefore any issues related to the application of heat transmission and to interpretation of the results
will be closely related to similar issues with electricity transmission.

The introduction of heat transmission has here been implemented
using option heattrans, cf. balopt.opt.

See The Balmorel Model Structure for further documentation.
