* Equation  QRESHAREE  is with inspiration from equation QEEQ:
QRESHAREE(CCCRESHAREE)..

SUM(C$CCCRESHAREEC(CCCRESHAREE,C),
   SUM(IR$CCCRRR(C,IR),
     SUM((IS3,T),
       IHOURSINST(IS3,T)*
      (SUM(IAGK_Y(IA,IGE)$(RRRAAA(IR,IA) AND IGNOTETOH(IGE) AND GREE(IGE)), VGE_T(IA,IGE,IS3,T) )
    + SUM(IAGKN(IA,IGE)$(RRRAAA(IR,IA)  AND IGNOTETOH(IGE) AND GREE(IGE)), VGEN_T(IA,IGE,IS3,T)))    )

))

=G= RESHAREE(CCCRESHAREE)* SUM(C$CCCRESHAREEC(CCCRESHAREE,C), SUM(IR$CCCRRR(C,IR),  DE_Y(IR)));
