* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between 3.02 and 3.03 (20160623). Main changes only.
All identifiers with "zzzDERATE" have been replaced by "zzzRATE"
    as response to factual practice by some users,
    and because RATE provides wider range of values (e.g. greater than 1) than DERATE
    zzzRATE input data may be obtained from zzzDERATE as zzzRATE = 1-zzzDERATE.
HYRSDATAS renamed HYRSDATASET
Removed DAYTYPE, SCENARIO, SCENARSIM, IDAYSIN_S, IHOURSIN24.
Added  ALIAS: (CCCRRRAAA,CCCRRRAAAALIAS), (IR,IRE,IRI), (FFF,IFFFALIAS), (S,IS3LOOPSET).
Added acronyms GSOLH, GWAVE, GHSTOS, GESTOS for new technology types.
GHSTOS and GESTOS are for inter-seasonal storage types that link between seasons, while intra-seasonal storage types GHSTO and GESTO no not.
Added internal sets IGHSTOALL, IGESTOALL, IGWAVE, IAGK, WAVE_VAR_T, IWAVESUMST, WAVEFLH, VGF_T, VGFN_T, QHYMAXG.
Added a number of VQxxx variables.
Added a number of tax data possibilities.
Used acronyms more consistently in relation to GDTYPE and fueltype.
In particulare note that the data file FFF.inc contains (as an exception) two types of info: SET FFF and ACRONYMS (the elements in FFF and the acronyms must be identical)
Use of default values (to possibly reduce size of input data files or as first shot on workable data) have been introduced in a number of parameters:
    GEFFRATE, XKRATE, GKRATE, GKNMAX, IGKRATE, IXKRATE (GOMVCOST, GOMFCOST and GINVCOST as previously).
Use of domain overloading to permit choise of level of detail in input data files to not require more data than needed for a specific application or than available:
    GMINF, GMAXF, GEQF, XKRATE, GKRATE. Cf. balopt.opt.
Modified equations  QESTOVOLT, QESTOVOLTS, QHSTOVOLT, QHSTOVOLTS introducing factor (CARD(S)/CARD(SSS)).
New: ALIAS(CCCRRRAAA,CCCRRRAAAALIAS); ALIAS (FFF,IFFFALIAS);
Reduced the size of the large parameters by assigning 0 to unused entries.
Not all addons are alive and documented, some will be deleted others documented (put otherwise: a slight mess).

Deleted SET SCENARIO, SCENARSIM



New options (cf. file model/options.inc):
unitcomm    unit commitment
stolinks:   permits overwriting the seasonal inter-/intra- linking for heat and electricity storages
HYRSBB123:  details on handling hydro storage in Babase3
bypass:     Bypass of 'turbine' (electricity production) on backpressure units.
timeaggr:   refinemetns on time aggregation (from (SSS,TTT) to (S,T))
GMINF_DOL, GMAXF_DOL, GEQF_DOL, XKRATE_DOL: Permit domain overloading - The options specify the domain (indexes) that the identifiyer is declared on.

Changes between 3.01, 3.02 (302.20110530) and 3.02 (302.20110920):

File Balmorel.gms:
   Fixed bug: QGKNSOLE and QGKNSOLH: changed index on VGKN
   Fixed bug: QGKNSOLH: changed VGEN_T to VGHN_T.
   Fixed assignment bug of IGF.
   Fixed minor bugs.
File bb123.sim: Fixed bug: VGEN_T.FX(IA,IGSOLH,S,T)$(NOT ISOLHSUMST(IA)) = 0; changed to VGHN_T.FX(IA,IGSOLH,S,T)$(NOT ISOLHSUMST(IA)) = 0;.
File Balopt.opt:
   Introduced PRINTSEPARATOR for permitting insertion of separators like ';' for use with e.g. copy-paste to Excel.
   Applied PRINTSEPARATOR in some, but not all, print files in folder printinc.
File print1.inc:
   Introduced scalars OTLW, OTLW1, OTLG and OTL1 for specification of field widths in relation to printing.
   Applied OTLW, OTLW1, OTLG and OTL1 in some, but not all, relevant print files.
   (OTLG and OTL1 were added for 3.02 (20110920) as the only change relative to 3.02 (20110530).)
Print files:
   Renamed some files:  ehf_cy.inc to ehf_gcy.inc,  ehf_ry.inc to ehf_gry.inc, ehf_ay.inc to ehf_gay.inc, ehf2_cy.inc to ehf_fcy.inc.
   Made consequential and additional minor other changes in these and other files.
   Removed file ehf_gfcy.inc and references to it.
   Revised prt3-bb2.inc with respect to sequence of technologies, from All/Old/New to Old/New/All, calculated All as sum of Old and New,
   and provided better handling with respect to $IAGK_Y and $IAGKN.
