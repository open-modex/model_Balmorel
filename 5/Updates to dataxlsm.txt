# Cross-modelling data preparation

*The numbers refere to the sheet numbers in the Data.xlsm file.*

## Time and space:
01 - Geographical resolution
10 - Years, foresight and concidered countries 
17 - discountrate and lifetime of transmission lines

## Fuels:
06 - Check but probably no updates: some don't fit directly, i.e. hard coal -> COAL, oil -> FUELOIL, biomass -> WOODPELLETS
18 - if 06 is updated
38 - Fuelprice
39 - MPOL

## Technologies
03 - GGG - lignite is also a fuel -> rename
04 - G
05 - GDATASET - important to know for filling out GDATA; if hydro_power is pumped, then storage eff missing
11 - GKFX
12 - GDATA
09 - investment areas

## Profiles:
40 - WTRRSVAR - area name in equation
41 - WTRRRVAR - area name in equation
43 - SOLH_VAR - area name in equation
42 - SOLE_VAR
47 - DE_VAR - sum of all sectors
49 - WND_VAR - missing data in excel
25 - FLH
32 - Total demand - careful with the unit: MWh insteat of kWh

## Transmission
34 - XKFX
35 - XINVCOST - missing data
37 - XLOSS

## Run before running full model:
auxils/Annuity_calculation/Annuity_calculation.gms

## Information only:
08 - DEUSER/DHUSER
39 - M-pol
44 - X3FX_VAR
